Count characters in your string - 6kyu

Instructions: 

The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

My solution 

function count (string) {  
// create an object called count
  let count = {};
  
  // split the string and loop over each character
  string.split('').forEach(function(s) {
  //if a character appears more than once, count 
  //how many times it appears, otherwise, 
  //count 1
     count[s] ? count[s]++ : count[s] = 1;
     console.log(count)
  });
  return count;
  
}

Optimal Solution:

function count (string) {  
  var count = {};
  string.split('').forEach(function(s) {
     count[s] ? count[s]++ : count[s] = 1;
     console.log(count)
  });
  return count;
}

Takeaway: 
in this case forEach is a much better option than a traditional for loop
