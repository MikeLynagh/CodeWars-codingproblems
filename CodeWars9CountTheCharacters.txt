Count the characters 7kyu

Instructions: 

The goal of this kata is to write a function that takes two inputs: a string and a character. The function will count the number of times that character appears in the string. The count is case insensitive.

For example:

countChar("fizzbuzz","z") => 4
countChar("Fancy fifth fly aloof","f") => 5

My solution:

function countChar(string, char){
// create a total to count appearances of char in string
let total = 0
// convert string to lowercase
let newStr = string.toLowerCase()
// convert char to lowercase
let newChar = char.toLowerCase()
// loop over string
for(let i = 0; i <= string.length; i++){
// if the index of the current string matches newChar
// add 1 to total
// return total 
if(newStr[i] === newChar){
  total ++
}
}
  return total 
}

Optimal Solution:
function countChar(s, c) {
  c = c.toLowerCase();
  return s.toLowerCase().split('').filter(x => x == c).length;
}


Lessons: 
My main oversight here was that I did not initially convert char to lower case, this meant I was failing the test whenever char was a capital letter.
